# Introduction
[This section should contain background and introduction to your general topic.] Loans are a fundamental aspect of not only the United States' economy but economies world wide. Loans provide funding to people lacking the current resources to consolidate debt, buy a house, buy a car, open a business, and any transaction that requires money. To make a profit, loans are expected to be paid back with interest. Companies want to know which applicants that apply for a loan will pay it back. Selecting a string of clients that default would spell disaster for the loaner. With teams of analysts, they build models to identify candidates. People on the outside of these lending companies want to know what traits make a candidate more or less likely to receive a loan. Using a dataset containing variables describing candidates that are accepted or rejected, the project will dig into the data to find insights and build visuals describing the population of both accepted and rejected applicants. Also, the project entails building a model that uses the features inherent in the dataset to predict whether a customer is accepted or rejected. The data belongs to a bank called LendingClub. LendingClub is an FDIC-insured bank that provides various loans.

# Dataset

[In this section, desribe the dataset(s). This includes things like where you
obtained the dataset. Include a full citation, as specified 
[here](https://guides.lib.umich.edu/c.php?g=282964&p=3285995). Describe how the
data was obtained by the data owner/curator, as best as you can. List the 
variables that you plan to use in your analysis, for example:

* weight: The patient's weight (kg)
* sex: The patient's sex, male or female
* age: The patient's age (months)

]
The data comes from a Kaggle dataset  @nath19. 

# Data Acquisition and Processing

[In this section, if applicable, describe how you will obtain the data (if it's
anything more complicated than a simple download). Discuss what data 
processing steps will be needed, such as recoding variables, data cleaning,
data tidying, imputing missing values, etc. See sections 1c, 1d, 1e in the 
"Good Enough Practices" paper.]


# Research Questions and Methodology

[In this section, list each of the questions you will explore. Following each
question, provide a detailed and specific plan for how you plan to answer the 
question. Include the specific steps you will take, what form the answer will 
take (a number? table? visualization? model? Give all the specifics), and 
estimate how many hours each question will take to complete.]

1. Is smoking correlated with diabetes? To answer this, I will create a filled
bar plot, with the left bar representing non-smokers, the middle bar
representing people who smoke moderately, and the right bar representing heavy
smokers. The bars will be the same height, and each bar will be
colored two colors based on the proportion of patients in the group who do or
do not have diabetes.

2. Question 2? Plan for question 2.

3. Question 3? Plan for question 3.

4. etc.
